<h1>JOBS IN GERMANY</h1>
    <p>
Germany has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the EU, reaching a record low of 5.8 percent in March 2017, while in some parts of southern Germany, such as Bavaria (where you’ll find Munich), the unemployment rate is significantly lower. A study by the German Federal Institution for Population Research showed that a third of non-EU migrants in Germany in 2010/111 found work within 12 months, although this situation has significantly changed following Germany’s refugee influx since 2015. However, if you are well qualified – with a university degree or a vocational qualification such as an apprenticeship – and have work experience and basic knowledge of German, there are much higher chances of finding a job in Germany, where such qualities are valued.

  <h1>
    Shortage German jobs
  </h1> 
  <p>
    There’s a shortage of skilled workers in certain professions in Germany. These include qualified engineers (mechanical, automotive, electrical, and building), IT specialists, health and social workers, and certain manufacturing positions. Professionals with vocational qualifications are also in demand in certain fields (see here for a list in German). With an increasingly older population, workers in the geriatric, health, and nursing professions are also in short supply. English teaching, casual work, and hospitality jobs are also available. Consultants for study in Germany can provide you with the complete information you require.
  </p> 
  <p>
    There are several large international firms in Germany, such as Adidas, BMW, MAN, Siemens, Volkswagen, Daimler, and Eon. However, the prevalence of small and medium-sized businesses is a key feature in the German economy, with more than 90 percent of German companies being SMEs and accounting for two-thirds of jobs. Consultants for study in Germany is the one you need to reach. You can also start with part-time jobs in Germany.
  </p>
  <h1>
    German work environment and management culture
  </h1>
  <p>
    The average working week is just over 38 hours, with a minimum of 18 days holiday a year. German business culture is traditionally hierarchical, with strong management. Germans work on carefully planned tasks and make decisions based on hard facts. Meetings are orderly and efficient and follow a strict agenda and schedule, where discussions are held with the aim of reaching compliance and a final decision. Time is a well-defined concept in German business culture and people are very punctual, and you should be too in any professional environment. The national German minimum wage was increased to EUR 8.84 per hour in 2017, and salaries in Germany are expected to be reviewed every two years. German education Consultants can also guide you to the purpose you are looking for.
